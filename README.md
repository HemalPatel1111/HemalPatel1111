## 🚀 Featured Repositories

### 🎮 Santa in Danger – Part 1 (Godot / GDScript)

3D game prototype where Santa navigates a hostile environment, built with a modular architecture: separate scripts for characters, controls, weapons, HUD, and scenes for clean, testable gameplay logic.

> Focus: real‑time interaction, input handling, and scene organisation in Godot.

### 🧪 Science Simulation Suite (VB.NET / C# / C)

A collection of physics, math, and logic tools:

- **Inverse Law:** inverse‑square force simulator (e.g., gravity/central forces) with tunable initial conditions and scaling.  
- **Pendulum & Double Pendulum:** visualising linear and chaotic motion.  
- **Physics2D:** 2D circle‑collision engine exploring conservation laws and numerical stability.  
- **Elements 2D:** electronic‑structure visualiser for elements ordered by quantum numbers.  
- **Logic Gates, Graph Tracer, SmartRockets, Number Characteristics, Pendulum (2015–16)** and more for teaching and exploration.

> Focus: desktop simulations, numerical methods, education‑oriented visualisations.

### 🎥 FFmpeg Video Converter (C# / WinForms)

Full‑fledged Windows video converter that wraps `ffmpeg.exe`, with:

- A `Video` helper class reading duration and other metadata via Windows shell properties.  
- A GUI to pick files, choose formats, and run conversions without touching the command line.

> Focus: process orchestration, Windows integration, and practical tooling.

## 📚 Other Work

- **Group‑theory toolkit in C**: programs to generate multiplication tables, subgroups, cosets and classes for finite groups, used to produce MSc assignment reports and tutorials.
- **Version Control System slides**: Git/GitHub intro PPT used to teach classmates the basics of commits, branches, and collaboration.
